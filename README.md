##WeatherTF
I never actually check the weather, so it'd be nice if I could get pertinent alerts

1- users enter their location and phone details (number & carrier)
2- uses the forecast.io api to get weather in the location of a user
3- uses SMS gateways to send SMS messages

###(1) Use the new navigator.geolocation object in the browser to get the user's location automatically? (Not supported for IE < 9 . . . )
